The adverse  event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding,  symptom or disease. The general definition of AEFI specifies that the event is  not necessarily due to the vaccine. An AEFI can be classified by the following  cause specific categories: ', '\r\n  ', 'Vaccine product-related  reaction:', ' an AEFI that is caused or precipitated by a  vaccine due to one or more of the inherent properties of the vaccine product (examples  include vaccination site pain, fever and anaphylaxis). ', '\r\n  ', 'Vaccine quality defect-related  reaction:', ' an AEFI that is caused or precipitated by a  vaccine that is due to one or more quality defects of the vaccine product,  including its administration device as provided by the manufacturer. Quality  defect is defined as any deviation of the vaccine product as manufactured from  its set quality specifications. (Example: failure to inactivate polio virus in  some Salk vaccine lots prepared by Cutter laboratories in 1955 resulting in  poliovirus infection among some vaccinees.) ', '\r\n  ', 'Immunization error-related  reaction:', ' an AEFI that is caused by inappropriate usage and,  therefore, by its nature is preventable.

', ' Given the importance of serious AEFI reporting, all  such reports are referred by provincial/territorial public health authorities  to PHAC within 15 days of becoming aware of the event and processed at the  national level within 2 working days. Market authorization holders are required  to report serious events to Health Canada within the same 15 day  timeframe.

', 'Investigating  and managing AEFI', 'It is important to use standard case definitions for  AEFI investigation and reporting. The Canadian Adverse Event Following Immunization  Surveillance System (CAEFISS) AEFI report form has been structured to  facilitate establishing whether or not reported events meet standard case  definitions for AEFIs considered to be of special public health importance (e.g.,  anaphylaxis, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode, febrile seizure,  intussusception).', ' It is also important to  consider and investigate coincidental causes of an AEFI. This can be done after  the initial report with additional relevant information provided at a later  date. Establishing that an adverse event was actually coincidental and not causal  is important for making appropriate decisions about future immunizations for a  given individual.

Vaccine  attributable risk is defined as the difference between the frequency of the  event in the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated population. Determination  of vaccine attributable risk is primarily done through research studies. ', ' A', ' placebo-controlled  randomized control trial ', 'is the most rigorous study design, especially  those using a cross-over design. An elegant example of such a design is a  Finnish study involving 581 twin pairs where one twin of each pair was first  given the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and 3 weeks later given a placebo.  The other twin in the pair first received placebo and 3 weeks later the MMR  vaccine. This was done in a double-blinded fashion (i.e., neither the  researchers nor the subject caretakers knew whether a given injection was MMR  vaccine or placebo). Adverse events were monitored for 21 days after immunization.  The results of this classic study are shown in Table 3 and demonstrate two key  points. First, fever is a common childhood event affecting 16% to 18% of the  placebo group – i.e., a temporally associated coincidental event, related  neither to vaccine nor to immunization. Secondly, the risk of fever  attributable to MMR vaccine is 2% to 6% and occurs in the interval from 7 to 12  days after immunization.', '\r\n  ', '\r\n  Table 1: Placebo-controlled randomized cross-over design to determine proportion of fever attributable to MMR vaccine', 'Footnote ', '1', '\r\n  ', '\r\n  ', '\r\n    ', '\r\n      ', '\xa0', '\r\n      ', 'Days after injection', '\r\n    ', '\r\n    ', '\r\n      ', '1 - 6', '\r\n      ', '7 - 8', '\r\n      ', '9 - 10', '\r\n      ', '11 - 12', '\r\n      ', '13 - 21', '\r\n    ', '\r\n  ', '\r\n  ', '\r\n    ', '\r\n      ', '\r\n          ', '\r\n            ', 'Footnote 1', '\r\n            ', '\r\n              ', 'Calculated from data presented in Table II in Peltola H, Heinonen OP.

In Canada, this type of design was used to study the frequency of  adverse events among a cohort of children given three successive doses of  hepatitis B vaccine.   The measured  outcomes were the number of illnesses or clinical symptoms compatible with any adverse  event recorded during one week intervals from 4 weeks before to 3 weeks after  each vaccine dose. Recorded adverse events increased in the week after  hepatitis B immunization but returned to pre-vaccination levels thereafter. The  attributable increase in adverse events due to hepatitis B vaccine was limited  to the first week after immunization and was 44%, 26% and 38% after doses 1, 2  and 3 respectively.', ' The', ' self-controlled  case series design', ' is a powerful method for  determining vaccine attributable risk for very rare adverse events. The risk of  an event occurring during a defined period following vaccine exposure is  compared to the risk of the event occurring in the same individual during  intervals of similar length but without vaccine exposure. This technique has  been successfully applied to address vaccine safety controversies (e.g., lack  of causal link between MMR or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism) as  well as to quantify the attributable risk for some rare events that have been  causally linked to vaccine such as thrombocytopenia following measles  containing vaccines. ', 'Individual case causality  assessment of AEFI', 'It is nearly impossible to assess causality without a thorough  investigation, near to the time an event occurs. This is especially important  for serious as well as unexpected AEFI, and it underscores the important role  that immunization and other healthcare providers have in managing AEFI. ', ' The WHO guidelines for individual case assessment are an important tool  for determining causality based on standardized case definitions that are provided  by the Brighton Collaboration.', ' The stepwise algorithm provided in the guidelines takes into  consideration evidence for known vaccine product-related reactions as well as  individual case history and other details which may point to anxiety,  immunization error or coincidental root cause for the AEFI. In addition to helping  identify actions that are needed to rule out coincidental causes of an AEFI and  make decisions about the safety of repeated immunization in individuals, these  guidelines can also be used by program administrators to guide the  investigation of AEFI clusters, and identify possible new vaccine – adverse  event associations which may require further study. ', ' ', ' In addition, challenge – dechallenge – rechallenge  events may also be used to establish causality. This applies much more  frequently to drugs than to vaccines.  An  example would be drug-associated rashes which appear after starting a drug  (challenge), disappear after stopping the drug (dechallenge), and reappear upon  re-exposure to the same drug (rechallenge).   Given the immunologic properties of vaccines, dechallenge is difficult  to achieve. The American Health and Medicine Division has accepted challenge –  rechallenge events as mechanistic evidence that tetanus toxoid may cause  Guillain-Barré Syndrome.  This was based  on a single case report of a man who developed GBS within 2 weeks following  exposure to tetanus toxoid vaccine on three separate occasions.', ' While individual case investigation may be able to establish  a vaccine – adverse event causal association, it cannot determine vaccine attributable  risk.
