The child suddenly becomes silent but remains agitated. Facial flushing and perioral cyanosis deepens as breath-holding continues. Some episodes end with resumption of crying, but others end with a brief period of unconsciousness during which breathing resumes. No treatment is required beyond reassurance of the child and parents.', 'Hyperventilation', "People experiencing anxiety may appear fearful, pale and diaphoretic. They may complain of lightheadedness, dizziness and numbness, as well as tingling of the face and extremities. Hyperventilation is usually evident. Treatment consists of reassurance and encouraging the individual to breathe slowly and deeply. Initiating a refocusing activity, such as asking the person to count to ten, may help. Should there be another condition causing the hyperventilation, such as asthma or heart attack, holding one's breath could worsen the condition.", 'Vasovagal syncope (fainting)', 'Fainting itself has no adverse consequence but during a fall, severe head injuries could occur.', 'Fainting is common with at least one lifetime occurrence in about 3.5% of women and 3% of men.

Therefore, a ', 'sudden loss of consciousness in young children should be presumed to be anaphylaxis', ', especially if other clinical features of anaphylaxis are present.', 'Table 1', ' lists clinical features that differentiate fainting due to vasovagal syncope from anaphylaxis.', 'Fainting usually occurs during immunization or within minutes of immunization. The individual may complain of feeling faint or light-headed, then suddenly become pale, lose consciousness and collapse to the ground. This may be accompanied by brief clonic seizure activity (i.e., rhythmic jerking of the limbs). As a general rule, the respiratory rate is normal and not laboured, but may be shallow. Cardiovascular signs include bradycardia and faint peripheral pulses but usually the carotid pulse is strong. In addition to pallor, the skin may be cool and clammy. There may be associated nausea and vomiting. Fainting is managed by placing the vaccinee in a supine (lying on their back) position and elevating the lower extremities. If vomiting has occurred or is imminent, position the vaccinee lying on one side. If the vaccinee is pregnant, position them lying on their left side. Recovery of consciousness and resolution of limb jerking usually occurs within a minute or two. The person may remain pale, diaphoretic and mildly hypotensive for several minutes.

In addition, it causes increased heart rate, increased force of cardiac contractions, increased bronchodilation, and decreased release of histamine and other mediators of inflammation. EPINEPHrine reaches peak plasma and tissue concentrations rapidly.', 'Failure to administer EPINEPHrine promptly may result in greater risk to the vaccinee with anaphylaxis than using EPINEPHrine improperly.', 'If uncertain, err on the side of treatment; ', 'there are no contraindications to the use of EPINEPHrine', '. If time is lost early in the treatment of an acute anaphylactic episode, subsequent management can become more difficult.', 'EPINEPHrine 0.01\xa0mg/kg body weight of 1:1000 (1\xa0mg/mL) solution (max 0.5 mg) should be administered into the mid-anterolateral aspect of the thigh (', 'vastus lateralis', ' muscle); the deltoid muscle of the arm should not be used as it is not as effective as the thigh in absorbing EPINEPHrine. Scissors may be needed to cut clothing to establish access. If scissors are not readily available, EPINEPHrine may be administered through clothing. Although there is a slightly increased risk of infection, timely administration of EPINEPHrine is the priority. The risk of infection can be addressed once the person has stabilized. For infants weighing less than 5 kg, the dose of EPINEPHrine should be determined by weight, if possible. For example, an infant weighing 4\xa0kg (8.8 lb) should receive 0.04\xa0mg of EPINEPHrine, which is 0.04\xa0mL of a 1\xa0mg/mL solution. However, if a vial is not available at the time of anaphylaxis, the 0.15 mg EPINEPHrine autoinjector device can be safely used. (Refer to ', 'Table 4', ' for EPINEPHrine dosing guidelines). Mild and transient effects such as pallor, tremor, anxiety, palpitations, headache and dizziness occur within minutes after injection of a recommended dose of EPINEPHrine. These effects confirm that a therapeutic dose has been given.', 'Antihistamines', 'Antihistamines (first generation and second generation) have no role in preventing or treating respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms of anaphylaxis in a community setting and should never be used in place of EPINEPHrine.', 'Swelling and urticarial rash at the injection site', 'Swelling and urticarial rash (i.e., hives) at the injection site can occur and may be the first indication of an evolving anaphylaxis. For this reason, while such reactions are not always caused by an allergic reaction, the individual should be observed for at least 30 minutes in order to ensure that the swelling or hives remain localized. Ice can be applied to the injection site for comfort. If the hives or swelling disappears and there is no evidence of any progression to other parts of the body and there are no other symptoms within the 30-minute observation period, no further observation is necessary. However, ', 'if any other symptoms arise, even if considered mild (e.g., sneezing, nasal congestion, tearing, coughing, facial flushing), or if there is evidence of any progression of the hives or swelling to other parts of the body during the 30-minute observation period, EPINEPHrine should be given', ' (refer to the ', 'Steps for basic management of anaphylaxis in a  non-hospital setting', ').
