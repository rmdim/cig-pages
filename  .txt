Each immunocompromised person is different and presents unique considerations regarding immunization. The relative degree of immunodeficiency is variable depending on the underlying condition, the progression of disease and use of immunosuppressive agents. \xa0Immunodeficiency can also vary over time in many people and the decision to recommend for or against a particular vaccine will depend upon a case-by-case analysis of the risks and benefits. There is potential for serious illness and death if immunocompromised people are under-immunized and every effort should be made to ensure adequate protection through immunization; however, inappropriate use of live vaccines can cause serious adverse events in some immunocompromised people as a result of uncontrolled replication of the vaccine virus or bacterium.', 'Primary care providers and specialists caring for immunocompromised patients share responsibility for ensuring appropriate vaccination of immunocompromised patients and their households.

If serologic testing is available and there is a clear antibody correlate of protection, measurement of post-immunization antibody titres to determine immune response and guide re-vaccination and post-exposure management should be considered.

If zoster vaccine is indicated, inactivated zoster vaccine should be considered.', 'Live attenuated vaccines', 'Live vaccines are generally contraindicated.\xa0 Because immunosuppressive drugs have been reported to cause reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection and predisposition to other opportunistic infections, avoidance of live vaccines during high level immunosuppressive therapy is prudent.', 'The safety and efficacy of live vaccines during low dose intermittent or maintenance therapy with non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive drugs are generally unknown, with the exception of varicella and live herpes zoster (HZ) vaccines, which can be considered for those receiving low dose methotrexate (≤ 0.4 mg/kg/week); azathioprine (≤ 3 mg/kg/day), or 6-mercaptopurine (≤ 1.5 mg/kg/day). Inactivated herpes zoster vaccine should be used unless it is contraindicated or unavailable. If combination low dose immunosuppression is being used, an expert should be consulted. A careful risk benefit assessment should be done if other live attenuated vaccines are to be considered in patients on low dose immunosuppression.', 'Infants exposed to immunosuppressive therapy in the womb', 'Special consideration should be given to immunizing infants who have been exposed to monoclonal antibodies in the womb.\xa0 Some monoclonal antibodies taken during pregnancy can, similar to maternal antibodies, pass through the placental barrier, potentially resulting in various forms of temporary immunosuppression in infants. For example, rituximab taken during pregnancy is associated with B-cell depletion in both mother and fetus, while infliximab can be detected in infants up to 6 months\xa0after birth.', '\n', 'Due to the potential risk of disseminated disease, administration of BCG and oral polio vaccines is contraindicated in such infants who are less than 6 months of age.\xa0 A longer interval of 6-12 months should be observed following rituximab therapy. Oral polio vaccine is no longer used in Canada but continues to be used in some other countries.', '\n', 'There are no data at this time regarding the potential risk associated with rotavirus (RV) vaccine in these infants.\xa0 Prior to RV immunization, laboratory tests may be useful in assessing humoral and cellular immune status. When considering immunization in the absence of laboratory test results, the decision to immunize should be based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. For example, in jurisdictions with ongoing RV immunization programs, indirect protection through herd immunity is likely to be high and withholding immunization may be considered until more information about the effects of monoclonal antibodies in the womb becomes available.\xa0 Alternatively, in jurisdictions that do not have RV immunization programs and where exposure to wild-type rotavirus may be high, immunization with RV vaccine may be prudent to reduce the risk of potential complications from RV infection.', '\n', 'Immune responses to live vaccines that are administered at or after one year of age (e.g. MMR or MMRV vaccine) are not considered to be affected by exposure to monoclonal antibodies in the womb.\xa0', '\n', 'Infants exposed to monoclonal antibodies in the womb should receive all inactivated vaccines according to routine schedule, keeping in mind that immune response during the first few months may be suboptimal, depending on the monoclonal used and the gestational period during which it was administered. \xa0', '\n', 'Monoclonal antibodies administered to the mother during breastfeeding are thought to have very little or no impact on the infant. Transfer of monoclonal antibodies through breast milk is limited, and the minimal quantities that are ingested are likely to be broken down in the infant’s gastrointestinal tract. Infants of breastfeeding women receiving monoclonal antibody treatment post-partum should therefore be immunized with both live and inactivated vaccines according to routine schedules, unless the infant was also exposed to monoclonal antibody in the womb.', 'Refer to ', 'vaccine-specific chapters', ' in Part 4 for additional information.', 'HIV infection', 'The degree of immune suppression varies widely among HIV-infected individuals, reflecting disease stage and response to antiretroviral therapy. Immune suppression is approximately predicted by a recent CD4 count and CD4 percentage.', 'Children who are immune suppressed at HIV diagnosis and have already received routine vaccines should have antibody titres measured where possible and, if indicated, should be revaccinated after immune recovery.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Inactivated vaccines', 'When possible, vaccines should be given early in the course of HIV infection although there is no contraindication to the use of inactivated vaccines at any time. If immune suppression is severe in an untreated or newly treated patient and likelihood of exposure to the vaccine-preventable disease is low, vaccination may be deferred pending immune recovery after effective antiretroviral therapy.', 'Inactivated vaccines should be administered to HIV-infected people according to routine immunization schedules, with the exceptions that hepatitis B vaccine should be given at double the routine dose and using a 3 or 4 dose schedule.\xa0 HPV vaccine should be given following routine age indications but using a 3 dose schedule regardless of age. There is a high risk of HPV-associated warts with HIV infection; HPV 9 or 4 valent vaccine will provide additional protection over that of the 2 valent vaccine. For those 6 months of age or older, annual immunization with inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended. HIV-infected people should also receive pneumococcal conjugate vaccine regardless of age, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine if 2 years of age or older, and one dose of Hib vaccine after age 5 years regardless of prior Hib vaccination. Quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine is recommended and meningococcal B vaccine should be considered. \xa0Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for those with risk factors for hepatitis A acquisition. If herpes zoster vaccine is indicated by age, inactivated zoster vaccine should be considered.', 'Live attenuated vaccines', 'The risks and benefits of a live vaccine need to be carefully considered in consultation with an infectious disease specialist/immunologist.', 'In general, infants should receive rotavirus vaccine according to routine schedule, as risk from infection with wild strain outweighs theoretical risk from the vaccine. If the infant is known to have severe immunodeficiency, consultation with a specialist is recommended.', 'MMR, varicella, live herpes zoster vaccines may be considered early in the course of HIV-infection if immune function is normal. Although LAIV is generally contraindicated, studies have shown it to be safe and immunogenic and many experts would consider using it for HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy and with normal immune function (see below). MMRV and other live vaccines are contraindicated at this time because of lack of data on safety. If immune suppression is already advanced at diagnosis, live vaccines should be deferred pending potential immune recovery with treatment. Consensus thresholds based on immunologic categories have been determined for the use of MMR, univalent varicella, live zoster vaccines and LAIV as follows:', '\n', 'Asymptomatic HIV-infected children 12 months of age and older without severe immunosuppression (i.e., CD4\xa0 ≥ 15% and CD4 cell count ≥ 500 × 10', '6', '/L for at least 6 months in children 1 through 5 years old and ≥ 15% and CD4 cell count ≥ 200\xa0× 10', '6', '/L for at least 6 months in those \xa06 through 13 years of age) may receive MMR and univalent varicella vaccines.', '\n', 'Immunization with MMR may be considered for susceptible HIV-infected adolescents and adults with CD4 cell count ≥ 200\xa0× 10', '6', '/L.\xa0There are no published data on the use of varicella vaccine in susceptible HIV-infected adults.

Non-immunized close contacts of immunocompromised people should be immunized against pertussis, Hib, rotavirus, pneumococcus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, zoster and influenza as appropriate for age. Non-immune household or close contacts of immunocompromised people should be given hepatitis B vaccine. In addition, non-immune close contacts of HSCT recipients and close contacts of solid organ transplant candidates and recipients should receive hepatitis\xa0A vaccine if other risks for hepatitis A infection are present.', 'Vaccine viruses in MMR vaccine are not transmitted to contacts. Transmission of varicella vaccine virus from people with post-varicella vaccine rash occurs but is rare. Susceptible close contacts of immunocompromised people should receive MMR, MMRV, varicella or herpes zoster vaccine as appropriate for age. If the varicella vaccine recipient develops a varicella-like rash, the rash should be covered and the vaccinee should avoid direct contact with the immunocompromised person for the duration of the rash.', 'Infants living in households with persons who have or are suspected to have immunosuppressive conditions or who are receiving immunosuppressive medications can receive rotavirus vaccine. Following administration of rotavirus vaccine, viral antigen shedding in the stool may be detected in some vaccinees and may persist for up to 4 weeks. Transmission to household contacts occurs but is uncommon and many experts believe that the benefit of protecting immunocompromised household contacts from naturally occurring rotavirus by immunizing infants outweighs the theoretical risk of transmitting vaccine virus. To minimize the risk of transmission of vaccine virus during the 4 weeks after immunization, careful hand washing should be performed after contact with the vaccinated infant, especially after handling feces (e.g., after changing a diaper), and before food preparation or direct contact with the immunocompromised person.', 'Annual influenza immunization with influenza vaccine is recommended for close contacts of immunocompromised persons. Because of the theoretical risk for transmission, recipients of live attenuated influenza vaccine should avoid close association with persons with severe immunocompromising conditions (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients requiring isolation in hospital) for at least 2 weeks following vaccination.', 'Oral polio vaccine should not be administered to household contacts of an immunocompromised person. Oral polio vaccine is not available in Canada.', 'Smallpox vaccine is available in Canada only for selected personnel working with vaccinia virus in research laboratories, or if an exposure to smallpox were to occur. Generally, smallpox vaccine should not be administered to household or close contacts of an immunocompromised person in a non-emergency situation. If vaccination is required in an outbreak situation, precautions should be taken to prevent spread to the immunocompromised person and other household and close contacts.', 'Immunocompromised travellers', 'A growing number of Canadians with reduced immune competence are travelling to tropical and low-income countries.
