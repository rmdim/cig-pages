['\n', 'Previous Page', '\n', 'Table of Contents', '\n', 'Next Page', '\n', 'Introduction', 'Prevention of infection by immunization is not just for children; adults require immunization to restore waning immunity against some vaccine preventable diseases and to establish immunity against other diseases that are more common in adults. In addition, immunization of adults prevents infection and, therefore, subsequent exposure of young children and others at increased risk of vaccine preventable diseases. For example, adults who are in contact with infants should be prioritized to receive pertussis and influenza vaccination to reduce the risk of transmission of these infections to infants who are too young to be fully protected. Some vaccines are needed by all adults and other vaccines may be required due to individual risk resulting from occupation, travel, underlying illness, lifestyle or age.', 'In recent\xa0years, new vaccines such as herpes zoster and human papillomavirus have become available for adults. Despite these advances, the vaccination rates of adults in Canada are low, with the result that many adults remain vulnerable to vaccine preventable diseases.', 'Common reasons for incomplete immunization in adulthood include:', ' \n ', 'lack of recognition of the importance of adult immunization', ' \n ', 'lack of recommendations from health care providers', ' \n ', "lack of health care provider's knowledge about adult immunization and recommended vaccines", ' \n ', 'misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the risks of vaccine and benefits of disease prevention in adults', ' \n ', 'lack of understanding of vaccine safety and efficacy', ' \n ', "missed opportunities for vaccination in health care providers' offices, hospitals and nursing homes", ' \n ', 'lack of publicly funded vaccine and reimbursement to vaccine providers', ' \n ', 'lack of coordinated immunization programs for adults', ' \n ', 'lack of regulatory or legal requirements', ' \n ', 'fear of injections', ' \n ', 'lack of availability of up-to-date records and recording systems', ' \n', 'Adult immunization is an emerging issue that has seen an increasing emphasis in clinical care and health professional training programs.', 'Health care provider responsibilities', "Health care providers have a responsibility to ensure that adults under their care have continuing and updated protection against vaccine preventable diseases through appropriate immunization. When considering immunization, the person's medical history will help to determine whether other immunizations are needed in addition to routinely recommended vaccines. Refer to ", 'Immunization of persons with chronic diseases', ' and ', 'Immunization of immunocompromised persons', ' in Part\xa03 for further information on how health conditions may modify vaccine recommendations.', 'Health care providers should provide adults under their care with factual information about immunization, including:', '\n', 'information about vaccines', '\n', 'expert recommendations regarding the use of vaccines', '\n', 'benefits and risks of vaccination', '\n', 'cost of the vaccine if it is not publicly funded', '\n', 'possible consequences of declining a vaccine', '\n', 'where vaccine can be obtained if the health care provider is unable to provide the vaccine', '\n', 'When more than one dose of a vaccine is required for optimal protection, the health care provider should arrange follow-up to encourage completion of the vaccine series.', 'Strategies to improve vaccine uptake in adults', 'All adults should be counselled concerning their immunization status.

Practitioners should routinely audit immunization records during clinical encounters; scheduling record audits on a set birthday, for example, to coincide with a mid-decade birthday (i.e., 25, 35\xa0years of age, etc.), is one effective reminder strategy. Health care institutions should have policies addressing immunization issues for patients and personnel.", 'Additional effective strategies for increasing the uptake of immunization by adults include patient and health care provider education about indicated prevention practices, and increasing accessibility to immunization through immunization clinics and greater engagement of non-physician staff in the execution of immunization programs.

Either a meningococcal conjugate monovalent or a meningococcal conjugate quadrivalent vaccine, depending on local epidemiology and programmatic considerations, is recommended for young adults, even if they have previously been vaccinated as an infant or toddler. In addition, multicomponent meningococcal vaccine may be considered on an individual basis to protect against invasive meningococcal disease caused by relevant serogroup B strains. Adults with specific risk conditions (refer to ', 'Table 2', ') are recommended to receive meningococcal conjugate quadrivalent vaccine, multicomponent meningococcal vaccine or both vaccines, depending on the risk situation.

In particular, adults who have not previously received Tdap vaccine in adulthood, and who anticipate having regular contact with an infant, should receive Tdap vaccine, ideally administered at least 2\xa0weeks before contact with the infant.\xa0All pregnant women should receive one dose of Tdap vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 27 and 32 weeks of gestation.
