Today, although these disease causing bacteria and viruses still exist, such diseases are rarely seen in Canada. However, if the current vaccination programs were reduced or stopped, diseases controlled through immunization would re-appear in Canada. This phenomenon has been observed in other countries where large epidemics occurred following a decline in immunization rates, resulting in many preventable hospitalizations and deaths.', ' Immunization is important in all stages of life. Infants and young children are particularly susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases because their immune systems are less mature and therefore less able to fight infection; as a result, they require timely immunization. Older children and adults also require immunization to restore waning immunity and to build new immunity against diseases that are more common in adults.', ' Immunization directly protects individuals who receive vaccines. Through community (or herd)immunity, immunization against many diseases also prevents the spread of infection in the community and indirectly protects:', ' \n ', 'newborns who have not yet received all of their vaccines', ' \n ', 'people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, such as people who had an organ transplant or are undergoing treatment for cancer or other illnesses', ' \n ', 'people who may not adequately respond to immunization such as the elderly.', ' \n', 'Impact of vaccines on vaccine preventable diseases', 'Table 1', ', ', 'Figure 1', ', ', 'Figure 2', ', and ', 'Figure 3', ' illustrate the impact of vaccines on infectious diseases in Canada.

In addition to being one of the most beneficial, immunization is also one of the most cost effective public health interventions. ', 'Many vaccines provide savings in health care costs (refer to ', 'Table 2', '). This means that the cost of implementing the immunization program is less than the cost of treating the illness that would occur if the program was not implemented. Because immunization with these vaccines maintains health and results in cost savings, the decision to include these vaccines in publicly funded immunization programs is straightforward. Other vaccines, particularly those administered through routine immunization programs, are highly cost effective. This means that these vaccines are less costly than the health care or societal cost savings they produce. ', 'While newer vaccines tend to be costlier and may not be cost saving, they compare very favorably to other public health interventions in terms of cost per life year saved (refer to ', 'Table 3', '). In Canada, evaluation of the benefits and costs of new immunization programs is done by Provinces and Territories.
