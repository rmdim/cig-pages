Before an infant is vaccinated with BCG vaccine, the mother must be known to be HIV negative, and there should be no family history of immunodeficiency. Indications that an inherited immunodeficiency may be present in a family include a history of neonatal or infant deaths in the immediate or extended family. Such a history precludes BCG vaccination until immunodeficiency in the child is excluded.', 'If the BCG vaccine is administered accidently to an immunocompromised individual, consult an infectious diseases or TB specialist for treatment.', 'Immunization of pregnant women should be deferred until after delivery and generally should not be given if the mother is breastfeeding.', 'Extensive skin disease or burns are contraindications to BCG vaccination.', 'BCG is contraindicated for individuals with a positive TST, although immunization of tuberculin reactors has occurred frequently without complications.', 'Administration of BCG vaccine should be postponed in persons with severe acute illness. Persons with minor or moderate acute illness (with or without fever) may be vaccinated.', 'Refer to ', 'General Contraindications and Precautions', ' in Part\xa02 for additional general information. Refer to ', 'Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons', ' and ', 'Immunization of Persons with Chronic Diseases', ' in Part\xa03 for additional general information.', 'Drug interactions', 'The BCG vaccine should not be administered to individuals receiving drugs with anti-tuberculous activity, since these agents may inactivate the vaccine bacillus.', 'Other Considerations', 'BCG vaccination: post-immunization tuberculin skin testing/interferon gamma release assay blood testing', 'BCG immunization may result in a positive TST. The benefits gained by immunization must be weighed against the potential loss of the TST as a primary tool to identify infection with M. tuberculosis. The increasing availability of interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) blood testing may reduce this concern because the BCG vaccine does not produce a "false positive" result with the IGRA test. However, the IGRA test is expensive and not available in all jurisdictions in Canada. The usefulness of this test in children less than 5\xa0years of age has been questioned due to only a moderate concordance (69% to 89%) with the TST, although the IGRA is considered more sensitive.', 'BCG vaccine is one of the mostly widely used vaccines in the world and is currently given at or soon after birth to children in over 100\xa0countries. Vaccine may have been received by several population groups, including immigrants from many European countries and most developing countries. In Canada, many Aboriginal Canadians and persons born in Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador from the 1940s until the late 1970s were vaccinated.', 'If BCG vaccine is received in the first year of life, it is very unlikely to cause TST reactions of 10\xa0mm or more in persons 10\xa0years of age and older because tuberculin reactivity acquired through BCG vaccination in infancy generally wanes over time. Therefore, a history of BCG immunization received in infancy can be ignored in all persons 10\xa0years of age and older when interpreting a TST result of 10\xa0mm or greater.', 'If BCG vaccine was received between the ages of 1 and 5\xa0years, persistent positive TST reactions may be observed in 10% to 15% of subjects even 20 to 25\xa0years later. In persons vaccinated at 6\xa0years of age and older, up to 40% will have persistent positive TST reactions. BCG-related TST reactions may be as large as 25\xa0mm or more. Therefore, if BCG immunization was received after the first year of life, it can be an important cause of false-positive TST reactions, particularly in populations in which the expected prevalence of TB infection (i.e., true positive TST reactions) is less than 10%.', 'BCG immunization can be ignored as a cause of a positive TST under the following conditions:', '\r\n        ', 'BCG vaccine was given during infancy, and the person tested is now 10\xa0years of age or older. Although availability of the IGRA test is limited in Canada, IGRA testing has been shown to be a useful confirmatory test for latent tuberculosis infection in TST positive school children at low risk of TB infection who received BCG vaccine in infancy.', '\r\n        ', 'The person is from a group with a high prevalence of TB infection (true positives), e.g., close contacts of an infectious TB case, Aboriginal Canadians from a high-risk community, immigrants from countries with a high incidence of TB.', '\r\n        ', 'The person has a high risk of progression to disease if infected.', '\r\n    ', 'BCG vaccination should be considered the likely cause of a positive TST if:', '\r\n        ', 'BCG vaccine was given after 12\xa0months of age, AND', '\r\n        ', 'there has been no known exposure to an active TB case or other risk factors, AND', '\r\n        ', 'the person is either a Canadian-born non-Aboriginal OR an immigrant from a country with low TB incidence (e.g., Western Europe, United States).', '\r\n    ', 'Tuberculin skin testing should not be used as a method to determine whether previous BCG immunization was effective.', 'References', '\r\n        ', 'American Academy of Pediatrics.
