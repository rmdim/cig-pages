Non-specific or primarily respiratory symptoms occur in about one-half of infected individuals. Subclinical infection is common. Although complications are relatively frequent, permanent sequelae are rare. Before the widespread use of vaccine, mumps was a major cause of viral meningitis. Mumps meningoencephalitis can, rarely, result in permanent neurologic sequelae, including paralysis, seizures, cranial nerve palsies and hydrocephalus. Permanent deafness may occur, at an estimated rate of 0.5 to 5.0 per 100,000 mumps cases. Orchitis occurs in 20% to 30% of post-pubertal male cases and oophoritis in 5% of post-pubertal female cases.

MMR or MMRV vaccine can be administered in the routine manner to people who have a history of anaphylactic hypersensitivity to hens' eggs. Prior egg ingestion is not a prerequisite for immunization with egg protein-containing vaccine. For all vaccines, immunization should always be performed by personnel with the capability and facilities to manage adverse events post-vaccination. Refer to ", 'Anaphylactic hypersensitivity to egg and egg-related antigens', ' in Part 2 for additional information.', 'Children with a known or suspected family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency that is a contraindication to vaccination with live vaccine should not receive live vaccines unless their immune competence has been established. Refer to ', 'Immunocompromised persons', '.', 'MMR and MMRV vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk to the fetus. Refer to ', 'Pregnancy and breastfeeding', '.', 'Measles-containing vaccines are contraindicated in individuals with active, untreated tuberculosis (TB) as a precautionary measure. Although TB may be exacerbated by natural measles infection, there is no evidence that measles-containing vaccines have such an effect. Nonetheless, anti-tuberculous therapy for active TB disease is advisable before administering measles-containing vaccines and it may be prudent to avoid live viral vaccines in those with active TB disease until treatment is underway. Consultation with an expert in infectious diseases is recommended.', 'A history of febrile seizures or a family history of seizures is not a contraindication for the use of MMRV vaccine.', 'Administration of MMR or MMRV vaccine should be postponed in persons with a severe acute illness. Persons with a minor acute illness, with or without fever, may be vaccinated.', "It is recommended to avoid the use of salicylates (medications derived from salicylic acid, such as acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for 6 weeks after immunization with MMRV vaccine because of an association between wild-type varicella, salicylate therapy and Reye's syndrome.", 'Refer to ', 'Contraindications, precautions and concerns', ' in Part 2 for additional information.', 'Drug-drug interactions', 'Systemic antiviral therapy', 'Systemic antiviral therapy (such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) should be avoided in the peri-immunization period, as it may affect the reproduction of the vaccine virus and consequently may reduce the efficacy of varicella-containing vaccine such as MMRV. On the basis of expert opinion, it is recommended that people taking long-term antiviral therapy should discontinue these drugs, if possible, from at least 24 hours before administration of MMRV vaccine and should not restart antiviral therapy until 14 days after vaccine administration.', 'Tuberculin skin testing or Interferon Gamma Release Assay', 'The measles component in measles-containing vaccines can temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity, resulting in false-negative results. If tuberculin skin testing or an interferon gamma relase assay (IGRA) test is required, it should be done on the same day as immunization or delayed for at least 4 weeks after measles vaccination. Vaccination with measles-containing vaccine may take place at any time after tuberculin skin testing has been performed and read.', 'Human immunoglobulin or other blood products', 'Passive immunization with human Ig or receipt of most other blood products can interfere with the immune response to MMR and MMRV vaccines. Refer to ', 'Blood products, human immunoglobulin and timing of immunization', ' in Part 1 for recommended intervals between the administration of Ig preparations or other blood products and MMR and MMRV vaccines.', 'Selected references', '\r\n  ', 'American Academy of Pediatrics.
