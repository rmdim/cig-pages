In general, regardless of the time between doses, interruption of a vaccine series does not require restarting the series as delays between doses do not result in a reduction in final antibody concentrations for most multi-dose products.

If a dose of vaccine is delayed, it should be given as soon as possible and the schedule resumed.

Refer to ', 'Rabies Vaccine', ' in Part\xa04 for additional information.', '\r\n', 'Accelerated Immunization Schedules', 'In exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of unplanned travel or in outbreak situations when multi-dose vaccine series need to be completed as quickly as possible, accelerated immunization schedules can be used. Full immunization can be achieved by providing doses at less than the recommended interval or before the recommended age (see ', 'Table 1', ').', 'Doses given at less than the recommended interval', 'When providing vaccine doses at less than the recommended interval, it is important to know the minimum interval between doses in which an adequate immune response will be achieved. For example, the recommended interval between each of the first 3 doses of the childhood immunization series of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and inactivated polio -containing vaccine is 8\xa0weeks. However, if needed, the first 3 doses may be administered at minimum intervals of 4\xa0weeks.', 'Refer to ', 'vaccine-specific chapters', ' in Part\xa04 for additional information on recommended and minimum dose intervals for vaccine administration.', 'Doses given before the recommended age', 'Age recommendations for receipt of vaccines are based on the age at which the risk of disease is highest and for which vaccine safety and efficacy have been demonstrated. When providing vaccine doses at less than the recommended age, it is important to know the minimum age for administering the vaccine, since doses given before the recommended age may lead to a less than optimal immune response. For example, the minimum age for influenza vaccine is 6\xa0months because the vaccine provides poor protection in younger infants.', 'There may be circumstances in which administering a vaccine a few days before the recommended age may be appropriate to avoid missing an opportunity for vaccination ( for example, administering a vaccine a few days early to a child who reaches the minimum age for the vaccine on the upcoming weekend). However, generally, if a vaccine dose is given before the recommended age, the dose should be repeated on or after the date when the person reaches the age for which the vaccine is recommended. For example, although measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may be given as early as 6\xa0months of age, 2 additional doses of measles-containing vaccine must be administered after the child is 12\xa0months old to ensure long lasting immunity to measles.', 'Refer to ', 'vaccine-specific chapters', ' in Part\xa04 for additional information on recommended and minimum ages for vaccine administration.
