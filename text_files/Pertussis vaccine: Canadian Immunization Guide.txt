The incubation period is 9 to 10 days (range, 6 to 20 days), and may rarely be as long as 42 days.

The paroxysmal stage is characterized by bursts of rapid coughing, ending with an inspiratory whoop and sometimes post-tussive vomiting.

In the convalescent stage, recovery is gradual and may take\xa0weeks to\xa0months.', '\n', 'The clinical course varies with age.
