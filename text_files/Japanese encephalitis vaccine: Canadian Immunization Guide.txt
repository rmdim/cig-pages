Secondary epizootic cycles can lead to infections of humans, often with domestic pigs as an amplifying host.', 'Transmission', 'JE virus is transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire the virus from infected hosts (e.g., pigs and wild birds) and then transmit the virus to non-infected hosts (e.g., humans and horses). The principal vectors are ', 'Culex', ' species mosquitoes that tend to bite in the evening and night. So called day-biting species predominate in some regions, but they not only bite in the day; they can also bite during the afternoon or evening.', 'Larvae of ', 'Culex', ' mosquitoes develop in standing water, such as rice fields. Thus, transmission of JE virus occurs primarily in rural agricultural areas where flooding irrigation is practised; however, cases have been occasionally reported from urban areas.', 'Humans usually do not develop sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes, and direct person-to-person spread of JE does not occur except, rarely, through intrauterine transmission. Based on experience with similar viruses, transmission could theoretically occur through blood transfusions or organ transplantation. The incubation period is 5 to 15 days.', 'Risk factors', "A traveller's risk for acquiring JE is determined by multiple factors, including immunization status, use of protective measures against mosquito bites, location of travel, duration of exposure, season, and activities while travelling. The risk for acquiring JE is low for most travellers, particularly for short-term visitors to major urban areas. Greater risk exists for travellers who are:", ' \n ', 'visiting rural agricultural areas associated with rice production and flooding irrigation;', ' \n ', 'staying for a long time; and', ' \n ', 'participating in outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, cycling or fieldwork, especially during the evening or night.', ' \n', 'Seasonal/temporal patterns', 'In most temperate areas of Asia, JE virus transmission is seasonal and disease usually peaks in summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission patterns vary and cases can occur sporadically or year-round.', 'Spectrum of clinical illness', 'Most JE infections are asymptomatic. Only a small proportion of people infected with JE will develop clinical symptoms. Less than 1% of people infected with JE virus develop clinical disease. In endemic areas, disease occurs primarily in children.', 'Acute encephalitis is the most commonly identified clinical syndrome with JE virus infection. When encephalitis occurs, it is usually severe, with 20% to 30% mortality rates and residual neuropsychiatric problems in 30% to 50% of survivors. Milder forms of disease can occur and are reported more commonly among adults. JE acquired during pregnancy carries the risk of intrauterine infection and miscarriage.', 'Disease distribution', 'Incidence/prevalence', 'Global', 'JE occurs in many areas of Asia, especially in the south east and in parts of the western Pacific, and is an important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 50,000 JE cases occur annually, with 10,000 deaths and 15,000 cases of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae. The incidence of JE varies widely from year to year and between regions within countries. In endemic areas, JE usually affects children living in rural areas. However, even in countries with effective childhood JE immunization programs, JE may present a risk to non-immune travellers because transmission is maintained in an enzootic (i.e., wildlife) cycle.', 'The overall risk for JE among persons from non-endemic countries travelling to Asia is estimated to be less than one case per 1 million travellers. However, the risk for JE among persons who stay for prolonged periods in rural areas with active JE virus transmission may reach levels similar to that of the susceptible resident population (1.2 to 2 cases per 100,000 per week). Short-term (less than 1 month) travellers whose visits are restricted to major urban areas are at minimal risk for JE although rare case reports suggest that even short-term, resort-based travellers can occasionally contract JE. There have been few cases of JE reported among Western travellers.', 'View a map of the areas at risk for JE transmission is available throughthe ', 'United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)', ' or the ', 'World Health Organization', ' (WHO).', 'Japanese encephalitis has been known to occur in many countries, including China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.

The protective antibody concentration declines over time with 80% to 95% of fully immunized vaccinees maintaining an adequate concentration at 6 months after the first dose and 60% to 80% maintaining adequate antibodies at 12 months after the first dose. A booster dose of vaccine, among those who have completed a properly spaced primary series, induces an adequate antibody concentration in those who have lost protective antibodies at 12 months after their first dose.', 'Recommendations for Use', 'JE vaccine is only one part of the prevention strategy for Japanese encephalitis. All travellers going to JE endemic areas should be advised regarding personal protective measures. These measures may be sufficient to reduce an already small risk of JE to a level at which JE vaccine provides little added benefit. For additional information on alternative preventive tactics and strength of recommendations for vaccination, refer to CATMAT ', 'Statement on protection against Japanese encephalitis', '.', 'Infants and children', 'JE vaccine is not authorized for use in persons less than 18 years of age due to little safety and efficacy data in this population. The pediatric traveller, especially the longer-term traveller, to areas endemic for JE may be at risk for JE infection and serious complications. If travel cannot be avoided or deferred, travellers less than 18 years of age should be advised to diligently use protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. When a child will be spending a prolonged period of time in an area at risk of acquisition, parents should be informed about the risk of disease occurring; the possibility of the child receiving a WHO approved JE vaccine at the destination should be explored; and the risk and benefits of receiving the vaccine "off-label" in Canada prior to departure presented.

The immunization series should be completed 10 to 14 days before potential exposure to JE to develop an adequate antibody response. An accelerated schedule is not available. However, if there is insufficient time to administer the recommended two-dose schedule before entering a JE risk situation, a single dose of JE vaccine may be considered and the vaccinee advised that protection against JE may not be reliable. Alternatively, simultaneous administration of two doses of JE vaccine (given with separate injections at separate injection sites) may be considered; however, the risks and benefits of this approach must be critically evaluated.', 'Booster doses and re-immunization', 'A booster dose (third dose) should be given one year after the second dose in the primary series, when there is a potential for re-exposure to JE virus. Persons at continuous risk for acquiring JE (laboratory personnel or persons residing in endemic areas) should receive a booster dose 12 months after primary immunization. Data on the need for further booster doses are not available. If a person received the previous mouse brain-derived JE vaccine more than 3 years ago and requires re-immunization, a two dose primary series of the currently available Vero cell culture-derived JE vaccine (IXIARO', '速', ') should be administered.', 'Serologic Testing', 'Serologic testing is not recommended before or after receiving JE vaccine.', 'Storage Requirements', 'Store JE vaccine in a refrigerator at +2属C to +8属C.
