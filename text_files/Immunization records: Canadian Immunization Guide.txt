Pharmacists who dispense vaccines should consider providing peel-off labels if they are not provided by the manufacturer.', 'Personal Immunization Records', 'Each vaccine recipient should be provided with a permanent personal immunization record. Vaccine recipients, or their parents or guardians, should be instructed to keep the record in a safe place and to present it at every health care visit so that it can be updated.
