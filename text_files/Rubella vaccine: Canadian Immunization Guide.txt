Transplacental transmission from an infected mother to her fetus during pregnancy may result in Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) in the infant. Infants with CRS may shed the virus in their urine and nasopharyngeal secretions for 1 year or more. The incubation period for rubella is from 14 to 17 days (range, 14 to 21 days). The period of communicability extends from 1 week before to at least 4 days after the onset of rash. People who recover from rubella have lifetime immunity.', 'Risk factors', 'People of any age who have not been vaccinated or have not had rubella disease are at risk of being infected. In Canada, routine infant immunization programs have resulted in sustained high rates of immunity in the general population, but the risk of limited transmission resulting from importation of rubella exists.', 'Persons at greatest risk of exposure to rubella', 'Individuals with the greatest risk of exposure to the rubella virus include travellers to destinations outside of the Region of the Americas, where rubella incidence may be higher.', 'Seasonal and temporal patterns', 'Historically, the incidence of rubella peaked in the spring and winter months in temperate zones; rubella is now limited to sporadic cases and outbreaks.', 'Spectrum of clinical illness', 'Rubella results in a transient erythematous rash, post-auricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy, arthralgia and low-grade fever. As symptoms are non-specific, it may be mistaken for infection due to other viruses. Adult infection is frequently accompanied by transient polyarthralgia or polyarthritis. Serious complications in children and non-pregnant adults are rare, and up to 50% of infections are subclinical.', 'Rubella infection during pregnancy often gives rise to CRS, which can result in miscarriage, stillbirth or fetal malformations, including congenital heart disease, cataracts, deafness and intellectual disability. Fetal infection can occur at any stage of pregnancy, but the risk of fetal damage following maternal infection is particularly high in the earliest months after conception (85% in the first trimester) with progressive diminution of risk thereafter, and it is very uncommon after the 20th week of pregnancy. Infected infants who appear normal at birth may later show eye, ear or brain damage. Congenital infection may give rise to such problems as diabetes mellitus and panencephalitis later in life.', 'Disease distribution', 'Rubella occurs worldwide; however, during the last two decades, rubella vaccination programs have greatly reduced rubella incidence rates in many industrialized countries. In Canada, routine infant immunization programs have resulted in sustained high rates of immunity in the general population and a significant decrease in incidence. Like rubella, CRS has been eliminated in Canada, although sporadic cases occur through prenatal infection acquired in endemic areas. There have been no cases of CRS due to a rubella exposure in Canada since 2000.
