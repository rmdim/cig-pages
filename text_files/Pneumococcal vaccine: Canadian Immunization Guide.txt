In many countries outside of Canada, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is in limited use. Refer to ', 'Immunization of Persons New to Canada', ' in Part 3 for additional information about vaccination of people who are new to Canada.', 'Serologic Testing', 'Serologic testing is not recommended before or after receiving pneumococcal vaccine.', ' Administration Practices', 'Dose', 'Each dose of pneumococcal vaccine is 0.5 mL.', ' Route of administration', 'Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should be administered intramuscularly (IM). Pneu-P-23 vaccine may be given either IM or subcutaneously (SC).', 'Refer to ', 'Vaccine Administration Practices', ' in Part 1 for additional information about pre-vaccination and post-vaccination counselling, vaccine preparation and administration technique, and infection prevention and control.', 'Interchangeability of vaccines', 'For routine infant immunization, Pneu-C-13 vaccine is the product of choice. Infants who have started an immunization schedule with a vaccine containing fewer serotypes should have their vaccine series completed with Pneu-C-13 vaccine.', 'Refer to ', 'Principles of Vaccine Interchangeability', ' in Part 1 for additional information about interchangeability of vaccines.', 'Concurrent administration of vaccines', 'Pneumococcal vaccines may be administered concomitantly with other vaccines, with the exception of a different formulation of pneumococcal vaccine (i.e. concomitant use of Pneu-C-13 and Pneu-P-23). There should be at least an 8 week interval between a dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and a subsequent dose of Pneu-P-23 vaccine, and at least a 1 year interval between a dose of Pneu-P-23 vaccine and a subsequent dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; refer to ', 'Immunocompromised persons', ' for information regarding administration of pneumococcal vaccines to HSCT recipients. Different injection sites and separate needles and syringes must be used for concurrent parenteral injections.', '\nRefer to ', 'Timing of Vaccine Administration', ' in Part 1 for additional information about concurrent administration of vaccines.', 'Storage and Handling of Immunizing Agents', 'Refer to ', 'Storage and Handling of Immunizing Agents', ' in Part 1 for storage and handling recommendations for pneumococcal vaccines.', 'Safety and Adverse Events', 'Common and local adverse events', 'Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine', ' Studies of Pneu-C-13 vaccine indicated that irritability; decreased appetite; increased or decreased sleep; and pain, swelling and redness at the injection site; after the toddler dose and in older children, are common side effects. Low grade fever occurred in 20% to 30% or more of vaccine recipients. In adults over 50 years of age, the most commonly reported side effects included pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache and new onset of myalgia, with fever above 38°C occurring in approximately 3% of vaccine recipients.', ' Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine', ' Reactions to Pneu-P-23 vaccine are usually mild. Soreness, redness and swelling at the injection site occur in 30% to 60% of vaccine recipients and more commonly follow SC administration than IM administration. Occasionally, low grade fever may occur. Re-immunization of healthy adults less than 2 years after the initial dose is associated with increased injection site and systemic reactions. Studies have suggested that re-vaccination after an interval of at least 4 years is not associated with an increased incidence of adverse side effects. However, severe injection site reactions, including reports of injection site cellulitis and peripheral edema in the injected extremity, have been documented rarely with Pneu-P-23 vaccine in post-marketing surveillance, even with the first dose. Multiple re-vaccinations are not recommended; refer to ', 'Booster doses and re-immunization', '.', 'Less common and serious or severe adverse events', 'Serious adverse events are rare following immunization and, in most cases, data are insufficient to determine a causal association. Few serious adverse events were reported in clinical trials with any of the pneumococcal vaccines, and consisted mainly of reports of afebrile and febrile seizure. Arthus-like reactions (causing a local vasculitis from deposition of immune complexes) are very rare and mainly occur in persons with high initial pneumococcal antibody concentrations. Anaphylaxis following vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine may occur but is very rare.', 'Guidance on reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)', 'Vaccine providers are asked to report, through local public health officials, any serious or unexpected adverse event temporally related to vaccination. An unexpected AEFI is an event that is not listed in available product information but may be due to the immunization, or a change in the frequency of a known AEFI. Refer to ', 'Reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) in Canada', ' and ', 'Vaccine Safety', ' in Part 2 for additional information about AEFI reporting.', 'Contraindications and precautions', 'Pneumococcal vaccines are contraindicated in persons with a history of anaphylaxis after previous administration of the vaccine and in persons with proven immediate or anaphylactic hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine. Refer to ', 'Contents of Immunizing Agents Available for Use in Canada', ' in Part 1 for a list of vaccines available for use in Canada and their contents.', 'In situations of suspected hypersensitivity or non-anaphylactic allergy to vaccine components, investigation is indicated, which may involve immunization in a controlled setting. Consultation with an allergist is advised.', 'Administration of pneumococcal vaccine should be postponed in persons suffering from severe acute illness. Immunization should not be delayed because of minor acute illness, with or without fever.', 'There are currently no data available regarding the safety of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children less than 6 weeks of age.
