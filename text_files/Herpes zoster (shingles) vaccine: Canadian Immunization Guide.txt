Less commonly, VZV can be spread by the airborne route if the affected person has disseminated HZ. Less frequently, transmission can occur from fomites, such as articles freshly soiled by discharges from vesicles or, in the case of disseminated HZ, mucous membrane secretions. The person who acquires VZV through these routes will develop varicella (chickenpox). The incubation period is from 10 to 21\xa0days, usually in the range of 14 to 16\xa0days. HZ is less likely to result in transmission of VZV than varicella. Persons with HZ are infectious until all lesions are crusted over.', 'Risk factors', 'Any person who has had varicella is at risk of developing HZ. However, HZ occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. Age is the most important risk factor for development of HZ. Over two-thirds of the cases occur in individuals over 50\xa0years of age. This age-related risk may be explained by both waning immunity over time following the initial varicella infection, and the loss of components of VZV-specific cell mediated immunity as a result of natural aging processes. The severity of illness associated with HZ and its complications also increases markedly with age. Up to 10% of persons over 65\xa0years of age will be admitted to hospital with an episode of HZ.', 'Spectrum of clinical illness', 'VZV causes two distinct clinical syndromes: primary infection (varicella, also called chickenpox) and reactivation of latent infection (HZ, also called shingles). Following varicella, VZV establishes latency in the sensory nerve ganglia, and may reactivate later as HZ. HZ infection is characterized by pain and a unilateral vesicular eruption, usually in a single dermatome. Complications of acute HZ are potentially severe.', 'The most frequent complication of acute HZ is PHN which is characterized by prolonged and often debilitating neurogenic pain that lasts for more than 90\xa0days from the onset of rash. Because treatment options for PHN are of limited effectiveness, PHN often has major adverse impacts on quality of life. Older adults, people living with chronic conditions such as diabetes or autoimmune diseases, and persons who are immunocompromised may be at greater risk of developing PHN. They are also at risk of experiencing longer lasting HZ rash than the general population. Other potential complications of HZ include ophthalmic sequelae (herpes zoster ophthalmicus), central nervous system infection, nerve palsies including the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome, neuromuscular disease including Guillain-Barré Syndrome, pneumonia, hepatitis and secondary bacterial infections.', 'The risk of mortality from VZV-associated disease is low.', 'Disease distribution', 'Incidence/prevalence', 'In recent studies, the lifetime risk of HZ has been estimated to be as high as 30% in the general population. In Canada, it is estimated that each year there are 130,000 new cases of HZ, 17,000 cases of PHN and 20 deaths.', 'Preparations Authorized for Use in Canada', 'Herpes zoster vaccines', '\n', 'SHINGRIX', '®', ' ', '(non-live recombinant vaccine, AS01B adjuvanted), GlaxoSmithKline Inc.
