Circumstances such as vaccine shortages, contraindication to a specific vaccine, changes in product availability, or migration across jurisdictions may necessitate giving vaccines from different manufacturers to the same individual over time. Because immunization schedules and specific products used vary across provinces and territories and among countries, questions about vaccine interchangeability may arise when evaluating the immunization status of persons new to Canada or people who have moved between jurisdictions.', 'General Principles of Vaccine Interchangeability', ' \n ', "In general, the same manufacturer's product should be used for all doses in a vaccine series.

However, if the child is eligible for TIV, QIV or LAIV, and the type of vaccine used for the first dose is not available; TIV, QIV or LAIV may be used for the second dose.
