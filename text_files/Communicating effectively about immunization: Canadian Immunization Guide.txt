Unimmunized children are at significantly higher risk of developing a vaccine preventable disease than immunized children. In addition, lower vaccination rates reduce the level of protection against a vaccine preventable disease at a population level (that is, community or herd immunity), potentially resulting in resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases and associated complications.', "Effective communication by health care providers has an important influence on people's decisions about whether or not to proceed with immunization. There is significant interest in understanding why some people are unwilling to receive vaccines and how their concerns can be addressed to encourage participation in immunization programs.", 'This chapter reviews what is known about vaccine hesitancy, describes basic principles of effective communication, and provides examples of immunization facts.', 'Vaccine hesitancy', 'Vaccine hesitancy is a term used to describe a refusal of vaccination or a delay in an immunization schedule due to concerns about immunization. Vaccines evoke concerns different from other health interventions because vaccines are generally offered to individuals who are healthy, as opposed to other health interventions that are predominantly intended for individuals with a disease. Vaccine hesitancy is a complex issue with multiple determinants, the most important being: ', ' \n ', 'lack of understanding about the vaccine being given and about immunizations in general; ', ' \n ', 'conflicting information from a variety of sources (for example, alternative medicine practitioners, anti-vaccination websites); ', ' \n ', 'mistrust of the source of information (for example, perceptions of business and financial motives of the vaccine industry); ', ' \n ', 'perceived risk of serious adverse events and concerns regarding injections (for example, pain and anxiety associated with immunization; coincidental rather than causal adverse events that are perceived as vaccine-related); ', ' \n ', 'lack of appreciation of the severity and incidence of vaccine preventable diseases;', ' \n ', 'sociocultural beliefs (for example, religious beliefs).', ' \n', 'Loss of public confidence in immunization can reduce the number of people who are immunized and result in resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases and associated complications. Evidence about the effects of misinformation, rumours, and anti-vaccine groups on vaccine coverage and consequent disease outbreaks in many countries is well documented.', ' The decision to immunize is a result of personal perceptions of complex vaccine and disease related information and the trust in individuals and institutions that produce, legislate, and deliver vaccines. Research has identified a number of factors that affect the extent to which an individual is trusted: perceptions of knowledge and expertise, openness and honesty, and concern and caring. Regular health care providers, such as vaccine providers, are perceived as trusted individuals and have a vital role in ensuring continued success of immunization programs and in maintaining confidence in the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. Besides demonstrating skills and expertise in the principles and practices of immunization, vaccine providers need to know how to counsel effectively and how to help vaccine recipients or parents knowledgeably to assess the benefits and risks of immunization, as well as the risks associated with being unvaccinated.', 'Principles of effective communication', 'The majority of Canadians feel that they are well-equipped to make informed decisions about immunization. However, there are individuals who remain concerned about possible side effects of immunization and who require additional information to make evidence-based decisions. Vaccine providers should make the most of each opportunity to encourage questions, to address misinformation, and to provide valid and appropriate messages and resources, including websites that provide reliable information. The following principles can be used by vaccine providers to communicate immunization facts effectively (refer to ', 'Immunization Facts', ') to vaccine recipients or parents:', '\n', 'Adopt a vaccine recipient-centred approach.', '\n', 'Vaccine recipients and parents should have input into the decision to immunize. Effective decision making is best done in a partnership between the vaccine provider, and the vaccine recipient or parent. Building these partnerships takes time and should ideally be established prior to the immunization visit. Vaccine providers should be transparent about the decision-making process, as well as honest and open about uncertainty and risks.', '\n', 'Engaging and motivating vaccine recipients and parents are best accomplished through dialogue. Motivational interviewing is a semi-directive method aimed at changing behaviour. Additional information about motivational interviewing is available from the Public Health Agency of Canada: ', 'Motivational Interviewing - Motivating Patients to Adopt a Healthier Lifestyle', '.', '\n', '\n', 'Respect differences of opinion about immunization.', '\n', 'Democratization movements and the advent of the internet have changed the environment around immunization from top-down, expert-to-consumer communication, to non-hierarchical, dialogue-based communication. With the public increasingly questioning recommendations of experts and public institutions on the basis of their own, often web-based, research, vaccine providers should anticipate that individuals will question the need for, and the safety of, immunization. Most of such individuals are not against immunization, but are seeking answers to questions about vaccine safety, immunization schedules, changing policies, and the relevance of some vaccines.', '\n', 'In general, events that are unfamiliar, involve a man-made process, involve loss of control, are mandatory, or involve a decision to do something rather than avoid something, are perceived as risky. Immunization, therefore, is perceived by some individuals as a potential concern, particularly when it comes to immunizing children.', '\n', 'Vaccine providers should determine the origins of vaccine hesitancy and take time to listen. Asking vaccine recipients or parents about their perceptions and discussing the benefits of immunization should be done using a non-judgemental and non-confrontational tone. Vaccine providers should clarify why a specific belief about a vaccine is held, especially if it is based on misinformation or misunderstanding. Demonstrating patience and respect builds trust and support for deciding to immunize. It is also important to recognize that, despite all the efforts taken, some individuals will not be persuaded into accepting vaccines.', '\n', '\n', 'Represent the risks and benefits of vaccines fairly and openly.', '\n', "Candidly communicating information about the safety of vaccines and their benefit-risk ratios is essential. For most individuals, vaccine safety is of primary concern and few are aware of Canada's robust vaccine safety system or that vaccines are held to a higher safety standard than medications. This process includes comprehensive reviews of efficacy and safety data before approval, oversight over good manufacturing practices and quality before product release, expert review of vaccine recommendations, post-marketing surveillance and rapid response to vaccine performance concerns, and international collaboration. Vaccine providers need to outline the work that is done to assess vaccine safety during development, regulatory review, and on an ongoing basis following use of a vaccine. Refer to ", 'Vaccine Safety', ' in Part 2 for additional information.', '\n', 'Through direct dialogue and using language that is appropriate to and understandable by the specific patient or parent, vaccine providers should contrast the known and theoretical risks of vaccines with the known risks associated with the vaccine preventable diseases. Potential risks of any vaccine should not be considered in isolation but in comparison with risks to the individual and community, should an individual remain unimmunized.', '\n', "Vaccine providers have a vested interest in the health of vaccine recipients. In addition to providing information, vaccine providers should provide immunization recommendations in accordance with the vaccine recipient's best interest; including expressing concern about the risks of vaccine preventable diseases, should a person remain unimmunized. It is also important to emphasize that, should vaccine preventable diseases occur, complications may not be correctable, even with the very best medical care. Refer to ", 'Benefits of Immunization', ' in Part 1 for additional information.', '\n', '\n', 'Clearly communicate current knowledge using an evidence-based approach', '\n', 'Vaccine providers should:', '\n', '\n', 'Assess the level and type of information that an individual wants and adapt the information provided accordingly; for example, some people will appreciate scientific evidence while others will prefer anecdotal information and stories from personal experience.', '\n', 'Present evidence in an understandable way; for example, concepts such as single event probability or relative risk may not be easily understandable for many vaccine recipients or parents; scientific jargon and acronyms should be avoided.', '\n', 'Frame immunization in terms of positive gains; for example, "A vaccine is 99% safe" is more effective than, "There is a 1% chance of side effects." Similarly, "If you decide not to get the vaccine, you increase your chances of getting a disease," is more effective than, "If you decide to get the vaccine, you decrease your chances of getting or transmitting a disease."', '\n', 'Use and have available varied information formats (visual, audio, printed material, websites), tailored to a range of socio-cultural groups (that is, educational level, language, ethnic and cultural background).
