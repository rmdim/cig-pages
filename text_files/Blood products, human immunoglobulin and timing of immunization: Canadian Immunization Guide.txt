Therefore, administration of Ig preparations and certain blood products can interfere with the immune response to parenteral live virus vaccines if given concomitantly with or shortly before or after the vaccine. The duration of the interference with the immune response to the vaccine is related to the amount of antibody in the Ig preparation or blood product. Exceptions are respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibody (RSVAb) and transfusion of washed red blood cells (which is infrequently used). These products do not interfere with live vaccines because RSVAb contains only antibody to respiratory syncytial virus and washed red blood cells contain a negligible amount of antibody.', 'There is minimal or no interaction between blood products or Ig preparations, and:', '\r\n', 'inactivated vaccines', '\r\n', 'live oral vaccines (rotavirus, oral typhoid vaccines)', '\r\n', 'live intranasal vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine)', '\r\n', 'Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine', '\r\n', 'yellow fever vaccine', '\r\n', 'These vaccines may be given concomitantly with, or at any time before or after, an Ig preparation or blood product has been administered.
