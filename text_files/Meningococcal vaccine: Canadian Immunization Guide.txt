Persons with HIV infection may be at increased risk for meningococcal disease, especially if HIV is congenitally acquired.', 'Seasonal and temporal patterns', 'Although disease occurs year-round, there is seasonal variation, with the majority of cases occurring in the winter and spring period in temperate climates, and in the dry season in tropical climates.

Symptoms of meningitis include intense headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, photophobia and stiff neck. Meningococcemia is characterized by circulatory collapse, hemorrhagic skin rash and a high fatality rate. Overall mortality is approximately 10%, and 10% to 20% of survivors have long term sequelae which include hearing loss, neurologic disabilities, and digit or limb amputations.', 'Disease distribution', 'IMD occurs sporadically worldwide and in focal epidemics. In Canada, IMD is endemic and reported year round with peaks in winter. Although people at any age can develop IMD, children younger than 5 are at the greatest risk, followed by people aged 15-19\xa0years and 60\xa0years and up.

Vaccination with conjugate meningococcal vaccine primes the immune system for memory and induces good anamnestic responses; however, anamnestic response may not be sufficient to prevent disease after exposure and circulating antibodies are thought to be essential. In comparison to polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine, conjugate meningococcal vaccines demonstrate greater immunogenicity and induce better immunologic memory. Conjugate meningococcal vaccines do not result in hyporesponsiveness and have been shown to overcome the hyporesponsiveness evident with polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine usage. In clinical trials, the 4CMenB vaccine has shown to be immunogenic in toddlers and children after at least two\xa0doses, and in adolescents and adults after one dose. In adolescents and adults, a more robust immune response has been observed in clinical trials following the use of a three-dose compared to a two-dose MenB-fHBP vaccine schedule.', 'Efficacy and effectiveness', 'A study of Men-C-C vaccine demonstrated effectiveness in infants of 97% within one year of vaccination, decreasing to 68% after 1 year. Longer term vaccine effectiveness requires receipt of a booster dose in the second year of life for those immunized in infancy. Vaccine effectiveness of Men-C-ACYW-DT within 3 to 4\xa0years of vaccination in adolescence is 80% to 85%; however, effectiveness wanes over time. There are no efficacy or effectiveness data available for Men-C-ACYW-CRM, Men-C-ACYW-TT, MenB-fHBP or 4CMenB vaccines.

The concomitant administration of MenB-fHBP has not been studied with other vaccines.', 'Men-C-ACYW-CRM can be administered with routine paediatric vaccines; however, further studies are needed with regard to concomitant administration with pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine. Co-administration of Men-C-ACYW-CRM and combined tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) may result in a lower immune response to the pertussis antigens than when Tdap vaccine is given alone; however, the clinical significance of this is unknown. Tdap vaccine given one month after Men-C-ACYW-CRM induces the strongest immunologic response to pertussis antigens.', 'If vaccines are to be administered concomitantly with another vaccine, a separate injection site and a different syringe must be used for each injection.', 'Refer to ', 'Timing of Vaccine Administration', ' in Part\xa01 for additional general information.', 'Storage requirements', 'Menactra', '®', ', NeisVac-C', '®', ' Vaccine, Trumenba', '®', ': Store in a refrigerator at +2°C to +8°C.
