Loss of potency can be accelerated under certain conditions of transport, storage and handling and may result in failure to stimulate an adequate immunologic response, leading to lower levels of protection against disease. Conditions that result in loss of potency vary among products.', 'Maintaining the potency of\xa0immunizing agents is important for several reasons:', '\n', 'There is a need to ensure that an effective product is being used. Administration of a compromising\xa0immunizing agent may result in the occurrence and possible transmission of a vaccine preventable disease.', '\n', 'Losses of\xa0immunizing agents are expensive and may exacerbate existing supply problems. Loss of\xa0immunizing agents may result in the cancellation of immunization clinics, resulting in lost opportunities to immunize, as well as increased costs to the program.', '\n', '\n', 'The recommendation for revaccination of people who have received a potentially ineffective\xa0immunizing agent may cause a loss of public confidence in vaccines and the health care system, as well as inconvenience for the vaccine recipient and the provider.', '\n', "A detailed discussion of storage and handling recommendations for immunizing agents is beyond the scope of the Canadian Immunization Guide. Detailed information for vaccine providers regarding vaccine storage and handling is available in the Public Health Agency of Canada's (PHAC) ", 'National Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines for Immunization Providers (2015)', '. Recommendations for vaccine storage and handling procedures may vary across jurisdictions, and if additional information is required, it is advised to consult your jurisdictional/local public health office or immunization program.', 'Handling of Vaccines', 'Immunizing agents are biological products which may become less effective, or even be destroyed, if exposed to light or temperatures outside the recommended range.', 'Vaccine "cold chain"', '"Cold chain" refers to the process used to maintain optimal conditions, particularly temperature, during the transport, storage and handling of vaccines, beginning at the manufacturer and ending with administration of the vaccine to the vaccine recipient. Monitoring of vaccines\' cold chain is required to ensure that these products have been stored and transported at recommended temperatures and in correct conditions. Exposure of a vaccine to environmental conditions outside those recommended for the product is called a cold chain break, breach or failure, or temperature excursion. Refer to the ', 'list of steps in handling vaccines exposed to inappropriate vaccine storage conditions', ' for product specific storage recommendations.', 'There are several negative consequences of breaks in the cold chain. Vaccines exposed to temperatures above the recommended temperature range may experience some loss of potency with each episode of exposure. Repetitive exposure to increased temperature can result in protein denaturation and a cumulative loss of potency that is not reversible. Some vaccines, such as those containing an aluminum adjuvant, experience a permanent loss of potency due to adjuvant clustering when subjected to freezing and thawing. Freezing of a vaccine or diluent may cause cracks in the container which may lead to contamination of the contents.', 'It can be difficult to assess the potency of a mishandled vaccine because there is little information about vaccine degradation; multipoint stability studies on vaccines are challenging to perform and information from manufacturers is not always available. Data are available to indicate that some products remain stable at temperatures outside of the recommended range for specified periods of time, but mechanisms rarely exist for monitoring the effect of cumulative exposures. Products that have been exposed to adverse environmental conditions should be managed in accordance with specific instructions from public health officials or the vaccine supplier.', "Ongoing cold chain monitoring is an integral part of immunization practices. PHAC's ", 'National Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines for Immunization Providers (2015)', ' provides detailed information on establishing standards for cold chain monitoring (i.e., temperature monitors in packages or on vaccine vials, freeze indicators) and evaluating awareness, equipment, practices and potential administrative errors during vaccine transportation and storage.', 'Single-dose vials', "Single-dose vaccines should be reconstituted or drawn up immediately before administration. They should be discarded if the vaccine has been drawn up or reconstituted and subsequently not used within the time frame specified by the manufacturer or local/jurisdictional guidelines. If the protective cap on a single-dose vial is removed, or if a manufacturer's pre-filled syringe is opened (e.g., syringe cap removed), the vaccine should be used on that clinic day or discarded.", 'Multi-dose vials', 'Once punctured, multi-dose vials should be marked with the date of initial entry into the vial and, if reconstituted, marked with the date and time of reconstitution. Some vaccines provided in multi-dose vials must be used within a specified time after initial puncturing of the vial or after reconstitution. This date will be different than the expiration date printed on the vial by the manufacturer. The new "use by" date should be written on the vial once it has been punctured.', 'Multi-dose vials must be maintained under appropriate storage conditions, between +2°C to +8°C (+35°F and +46°F), in a secure site to prevent tampering. They should be removed from the refrigerator (or cooler in community immunization clinics) only to withdraw the required dose from the vial. Vaccine providers should observe strict aseptic technique when using multi-dose vials.', "Manufacturer's recommendations or jurisdictional guidelines for use of multi-dose vials should be followed.", 'Reconstitution of lyophilized vaccines', 'For optimal potency, lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccines should be reconstituted immediately before use with the diluent provided by the manufacturer for that purpose. Refer to the product leaflet, product monograph, or jurisdictional guidelines for vaccine-specific recommendations regarding storage requirements for lyophilized vaccines and diluents, and the time frame for use following reconstitution. If not otherwise instructed by the manufacturer or jurisdictional guidelines, diluents that do not contain vaccine components and that are packaged separately from the vaccine may be stored at room temperature to conserve refrigerator space. The vaccine for which the diluent should be used must be marked clearly to avoid using the wrong diluent.', 'Reconstituted vaccines should be discarded if not used within the time frame specified for use by the manufacturer or jurisdictional guidelines.', 'Pre-loading vaccines in syringes', "Many vaccines are now provided by manufacturers in pre-loaded syringes. If a vaccine is not provided in a pre-loaded syringe, it should ideally be drawn into the syringe immediately before use. If pre-loading vaccines in syringes is undertaken in an office setting, vaccine providers should prepare only the number of vaccine doses that are expected to be administered during the consultation. If pre-loading vaccines in syringes is undertaken in an immunization clinic setting, vaccine providers should prepare only the number of doses required to keep the clinic running efficiently and doses should be used as soon as possible. If syringes are pre-loaded by a hospital pharmacy, labels should indicate the time by which the vaccine should be used. Vaccine administrators need to consider: the length of time the vaccine will be stored in the pre-loaded syringe; the type of vaccine (i.e., live vs. inactivated vaccine); the potential of exposure to light; the potential for interaction between the vaccine and the material used in the syringe; and the manufacturers' specifications for vaccine storage. Refer to ", 'Vaccine Administration Practices', ' in Part 1 for additional information.', 'Vaccine-specific storage and handling information', "For vaccine specific storage and handling information consult the product leaflet or information contained within the product monograph available through Health Canada's ", 'Drug Product Database', '.', 'Storage of Vaccines', 'Packaging', 'Store vaccines in their original packaging; the packaging provides protection from light and physical damage.', 'Refrigerated ', 'immunizing agents', '\xa0', 'The storage temperature for refrigerated vaccines and passive immunizing agents is between +2°C and +8°C (+35°F and +46°F).', 'Frozen vaccines', 'Store frozen vaccines at an optimum temperature of \xa0-15°C (+5°F ) or colder or as specified by the product monograph. It should be noted that the use of dry ice may subject vaccines to temperatures colder than −50°C. In general vaccines that have thawed should not be refrozen.', 'Exposure to freezing', 'Vaccines that should be stored at +2°C to +8°C (+35°F and +46°F) should not be used if they have been frozen. Diluent that has been frozen should not be used. Before use, vaccines should be inspected and not used if the usual appearance is altered or a temperature recording device shows that the vaccine was exposed to temperatures below 0ºC. If a vaccine has been exposed to freezing,\xa0refer to the ', 'list of steps in handling vaccines exposed to inappropriate vaccine storage conditions', ' and consult public health officials for advice. Additional information regarding stability of vaccines is available from the ', 'World Health Organization', '.', 'Exposure to heat', 'Refer to the section on ', 'cold chain break management', ' below.', 'Exposure to light', 'Vaccines should be stored in their original packaging and protected from light, as exposure to light may cause loss of potency in some vaccines. Some vaccines such as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, and Bacille Calmette-Guérin [BCG] vaccines should be protected from ultraviolet (UV) light exposure at all times. Exposure to light should be limited when pre-loading syringes.', 'Expiration Dates', 'All vaccines and diluents have expiration dates beyond which the product must not be used. Expiration dates are labelled on product containers (e.g., vials, syringes) and package boxes. When the expiration date is marked with only a month and year, the vaccine or diluent may be used up to and including the last day of the month indicated on the vial. If vaccine has been inappropriately exposed to excessive heat, cold, or light, its potency may be reduced before the expiration date is reached. If an expired vaccine has been inadvertently administered, it should not be counted as a valid dose and should be repeated, respecting the appropriate interval between live parenteral vaccines.', 'Vaccine Disposal', 'Vaccines that cannot be used because of expiry or breach of the cold chain should either be returned to the supplier for disposal or appropriately disposed of according to jurisdictional standards.', 'Refrigerators and Freezers for Vaccine Storage', 'General requirements', 'Any refrigerator or freezer used for vaccine storage must:', '\n', 'maintain required vaccine storage temperatures; under-counter bar or dormitory refrigerators should not be used because they do not reliably maintain temperature.', '\n', 'hold sufficient inventory, including vaccine for the influenza season, and should not be an under-counter bar or dormitory type refrigerator', '\n', 'have a calibrated temperature-monitoring device inside each storage compartment', '\n', 'be dedicated to the storage of vaccines only', '\n', 'be placed in a secure location away from unauthorized and public access', '\n', 'Central vaccine depots should be equipped with auxiliary generators for refrigerators in case of power failures.', 'Domestic refrigerators are not designed to meet the requirements for vaccine storage; therefore, precautions and modifications are needed if vaccines are stored in such refrigerators. A purpose-built vaccine refrigerator (pharmacy, lab-style or laboratory grade refrigerator) is the standard for storing large inventories of vaccines.', "Refer to Section 3 of PHAC's ", 'National Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines for Immunization Providers (2015)', ' for detailed information on vaccine storage equipment, including guidelines for purchase of vaccine refrigerators.', 'Temperature monitoring', 'The temperature in frost-free refrigerators may vary widely; temperature should be monitored to ensure that temperature cycling is within the acceptable range of +2ºC to +8ºC. Maximum/minimum thermometers are commercially available and are useful for refrigerators used to store vaccines in offices. Thermometer calibration should be accurate within ±0.5°C (±1°F). Constant chart-recording thermometers with alarms are appropriate for larger vaccine storage depots.', 'Current, maximum and minimum refrigerator temperatures should be recorded twice daily and local public health officials or the vaccine supplier should be contacted if vaccines are exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range. Refer to ', 'Cold chain break management', ' for additional information.', 'Recommended Office Procedures', "Refer to PHAC's ", 'National Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines for Immunization Providers (2015)', ' for detailed information on vaccine inventory management and storage practices. The following procedures are recommended to ensure that storage of vaccines in vaccine provider offices is optimized.', 'Inventory management', 'An adequate supply of vaccines should be maintained to meet the monthly needs of the served population. Do not over order vaccines since this increases the risk of wastage (e.g. cold chain break as a result of power failure, or expiry of unused vaccines). To ensure good management of inventory:', ' \n ', 'Designate and train one staff member to be responsible for managing vaccines and another staff member as a backup.', ' \n ', 'Limit access to the vaccine supply to authorized personnel only. This will help to protect the vaccine supply by avoiding inappropriate removal of vaccine or inappropriate handling of vaccine and vaccine storage units by untrained personnel. All staff handling vaccines should be familiar with policies and procedures for vaccine storage and handling.', ' \n ', 'Place vaccines into the designated refrigerator immediately upon delivery to the office.', ' \n ', 'Rotate stock so that vaccines with the earliest expiration date are at the front of the shelf.', ' \n ', 'Check inventory and expiry dates monthly.', ' \n ', 'Store vaccine products that have similar packaging in different locations that are clearly marked in order to avoid confusion and administration errors.', ' \n ', 'Place expired vaccine into a marked box and remove from the refrigerator for appropriate disposal.', ' \n ', 'Establish at least one alternate storage facility where vaccine can be appropriately stored and monitored in case of failure of the designated refrigerator.', ' \n', 'Refrigerator', '\n', 'Post storage and handling guidelines on the refrigerator.', '\n', 'Place full, plastic water bottles in the lower compartment and door shelves of the refrigerator and ice packs in the freezer compartment to help stabilize temperatures, especially in the event of a power failure.', '\n', 'Store vaccines in the middle of the refrigerator to avoid the coldest and warmest parts of the refrigerator; do not store vaccines on the door shelves or in the vegetable and fruit bins i.e. crispers of domestic refrigerators.', '\n', 'Ideally, store frozen vaccines in a separate, designated, frost-free freezer unit at -15° C (+5°F ) or colder.
