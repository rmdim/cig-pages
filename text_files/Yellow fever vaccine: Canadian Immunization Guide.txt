The incubation period is 3 to 6\xa0days. Humans infected with YF virus experience the highest levels of viremia and are infectious to mosquitoes shortly before the onset of fever and for 3 to 5\xa0days afterwards. Because of the high level of viremia in humans, bloodborne transmission of YF virus can occur through transfusion of blood products, intravenous drug use and needlestick injuries. Probable transmission of vaccine strain YF virus from a mother to her infant through breastfeeding has been reported. Vaccine-associated viremia occurs 4 to 10\xa0days after primary YF vaccination and lasts for up to 5\xa0days. Sustained transmission is not possible in Canada because the recognized mosquito vectors are not present.', 'Risk factors', "A traveller's risk for acquiring YF is determined by multiple factors including: immunization status, use of personal protection measures against mosquito bites, location of travel, duration of exposure, activities while travelling, and local rate of virus transmission.

Greater risk exists for travellers who:", ' \n ', 'visit rural or jungle areas;', ' \n ', 'stay for longer periods of time; and', ' \n ', 'participate in outdoor activities such as recreation or fieldwork.', ' \n', 'For example, risk is greater for travellers who stay in a rural area of an endemic country for over two\xa0weeks, whereas risk is low for travellers staying in an urban area in a transitional country for one week.', 'Seasonal/temporal patterns', 'In West Africa and South America, YF virus transmission is usually associated with the mid-to-late rainy season when the number of mosquitoes generally increases. However, YF virus can be transmitted during the dry season.', 'Spectrum of clinical illness', 'Clinical presentation of YF varies in severity from asymptomatic to fatal. When symptomatic, YF is typically characterized by an acute onset of symptoms including fever, chills, headache, backache, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, mild jaundice, and epigastric pain. In about 85% of YF cases, the disease resolves when the acute symptoms subside. For others, after a brief remission lasting anywhere between hours to a day, symptoms worsen and the disease advances, eventually leading to renal failure, haemorrhagic symptoms, and thrombocytopenia. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.', 'Disease distribution', 'Incidence/prevalence', 'Global', 'The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 200,000 YF cases occur annually, with up to 30,000 deaths. YF is endemic and intermittently epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. In South America, transmission of YF virus occurs mainly in forest areas rather than in urban areas. In Africa, the majority of outbreaks have been reported from West Africa. The mosquito vectors are present in Asia; however, there have been no documented cases of transmission.', 'Since 1970, there have been nine cases of YF reported in unvaccinated international travellers from the United States and Europe who visited YF endemic areas of Africa and South America. Eight of the nine travellers died. One case of YF has been documented in a vaccinated traveller.', 'The risk of YF varies widely within areas of transmission. One mathematical model suggested that for an unimmunized person taking a two week trip to an area of epidemic YF activity the risk of becoming ill from YF could be as high as 1:267 and the risk of death from YF could be as high as1:1,333. Although the actual risk for most travelers is probably less, it is very hard to quantify. It is for this reason that revised guidelines were required in order to make it easier for health care providers to give advice and care to travellers.', 'YF is unique among diseases in that there are international health regulations which outline the requirements for proof of vaccination when travelling to specific areas.

Whenever possible, infants aged 6 to 8\xa0months should not travel to countries where YF is transmitted.

Although the risk of serious adverse neurologic events is less than that of infants less than six\xa0months of age, it is still higher than that of infants 9\xa0months and older. At 9\xa0months of age, the risk of serious adverse events becomes much lower and antibody response improves, thus improving the safety and efficacy profiles of the YF vaccine.', 'If an infant receives YF vaccine at 6 to 8\xa0months of age, and subsequently travels after 9\xa0months of age, serology should be done (if available), and a booster dose considered.

While the effects of YF vaccine in pregnancy are not well documented, many pregnant women have received the vaccine without significant adverse events. In one study of women exposed to YF vaccine early in pregnancy there was slight increased risk noted for minor malformations (mainly skin) in the babies; no increased risk of major malformations was found.

This includes those travellers transiting to a country with an entry requirement for YF vaccination but no history of endemic disease. Defining specific entry requirements is under the control of each individual country. Some countries will not allow entry without proper documentation of vaccination or certificate of medical contraindication. Travellers without proper documentation may be denied entry or subjected to vaccination at the airport. This should be considered during review of itineraries and pre-travel counseling. If there is concern that lack of documentation will put the traveller at risk, yet vaccination is not medically indicated, then providing a medical certificate of contraindication may be considered. Unfortunately, some countries may deny entry despite proper documentation of medical contraindication to vaccination.', 'YF vaccination is generally not recommended in areas where there is low potential for YF virus exposure (refer to ', 'Table\xa02', '). However, vaccination might be considered for a small subset of travellers to these areas who are at increased risk of exposure to mosquitoes because of prolonged travel, heavy exposure to mosquitoes, or inability to avoid mosquito bites. Vaccination is not recommended for travellers whose itineraries are restricted to areas with no risk.', "The decision to immunize a traveller against YF should take into account the traveller's itinerary and the associated risk for exposure to YF virus, the requirements of the country to be visited (including stopovers and airport transit), individual risk factors (e.g., age, immune status), and the potential for serious adverse events following vaccination. Vaccine providers should check either the CDC or WHO website for an updated list of countries considered endemic or transitional for YF and/or requiring YF vaccination for entry.", "Under the WHO's International Health Regulations, YF immunization (documented by an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis) is required to enter certain countries in Africa and South America regardless of the traveller's country of origin. Other countries require YF vaccination of travellers if the traveller has passed through endemic areas. In some Asian and tropical countries where YF disease does not exist but the transmitting mosquito is present, immunization is required for travellers arriving from an endemic country to prevent importation of the disease.

Neurotropic disease occurs as a result of YF vaccine virus invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). The other syndromes are autoimmune manifestations in which antibodies and/or T-cells produced in response to the vaccine cross-react with neuronal epitopes leading to CNS or peripheral nerve damage. The clinical course is typically brief with generally complete recovery. Fatality is rare. YEL-AND can present in any age group, between 4 and 23\xa0days post vaccination (typically 7 to 21\xa0days) and is seen almost exclusively in primary vaccine recipients. Children less than six\xa0months of age and older persons are at greater risk for YEL-AND. The US CDC reports an incidence of YEL-AND of 0.8 per 100,000 doses administered.
