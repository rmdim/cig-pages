Each class of antibody has a different way of contributing to immunity.', '\r\n', "Immunologic memory is the immune system's ability to remember its experience with an infectious agent, leading to effective and rapid immune response upon subsequent exposure to the same or similar infectious agents. Development of a complete immunologic memory requires participation of both B and T cells; memory B cell development is dependent on the presentation of antigens by T cells.", 'Immunizing agents', 'Immunization refers to the process by which a person becomes protected against a disease through exposure to immunizing agents. Immunizing agents are classified as active or passive, depending on the process by which they confer immunity; prevention of disease through the use of immunizing agents is called immunoprophylaxis.', 'Active immunization is the inherent production of antibodies against a specific agent after exposure to the antigen through vaccination. Active immunizing agents are typically referred to as vaccines. Refer to ', 'vaccine-specific chapters', ' in Part 4 for information about active vaccines.\xa0', 'Passive immunization involves the transfer of pre-formed antibodies, from one person to another or from an animal product, to provide immediate, temporary protection from infection or to reduce the severity of illness caused by the infectious agent. Protection provided by passive immunization is temporary because the transferred antibodies degrade over time. Passive immunization can occur by transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to the developing fetus, or it can be provided by systemic administration of a passive immunizing agent.', 'In addition to the active component (antigen in case of vaccines or antibody in case of immunoglobulins), immunizing agents may contain additional ingredients such as preservatives, additives, adjuvants and traces of other substances. Refer to ', 'Contents of Immunizing Agents Available for Use in Canada', ' for more information.', 'Vaccines', 'Vaccines are complex biologic products designed to induce a protective immune response effectively and safely. An ideal vaccine is: safe with minimal adverse effects; effective in providing lifelong protection against disease after a single dose that can be administered at birth; inexpensive; stable during shipment and storage; and easy to administer. Some vaccines come closer to fulfilling these criteria than others. Although each vaccine has its own benefits and risks, and indications and contraindications, all vaccines offer protection against the disease for which they were created.', 'Vaccines are classified according to the type of active component (antigen) they contain and are most often categorized in two groups - live attenuated vaccines and non-live vaccines:', '\r\n', 'Live attenuated vaccines contain whole, weakened bacteria or viruses. Since the agent replicates within the vaccine recipient, the stimulus to the immune system more closely resembles that associated with natural infection, resulting in longer lasting and broader immunity than can be achieved with other vaccine types. Because of the strong immunogenic response, live attenuated vaccines, except those administered orally, typically produce immunity in most recipients with one dose; however, a second dose helps to make sure that almost all vaccine recipients are protected, because some individuals may not respond to the first dose. Live vaccines require careful storage and handling to avoid inadvertent inactivation.\xa0', '\r\n', 'Non-live vaccines contain whole inactivated (killed) bacteria or viruses,  their parts, or products secreted by bacteria that are modified to remove their pathogenic effects (toxoids). Non-live vaccines cannot cause the disease they are designed to prevent. Because the immune response to non-live vaccines may be less than that induced by live organisms, they often require adjuvants and multiple doses. The initial doses prime the immune system and are called primary vaccination or the primary series. As protection following primary vaccination diminishes over time, periodic supplemental doses (booster doses) may be required to increase or boost antibody levels.', '\r\n\r\n', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Passive immunization with immune globulins provides protection when vaccines for active immunization are unavailable or contraindicated, or in certain instances when unimmunized individuals have been exposed to the infectious agent and rapid protection is required (post-exposure immunoprophylaxis). Passive immunization also has a role in the management of immunocompromised people who may not be able to respond adequately to vaccines or for whom live vaccines may be contraindicated. The duration of the beneficial effects provided by passive immunizing agents is relatively short and protection may be incomplete.', 'There  are two types of antibody preparations available: ', '\r\n  ', 'Standard immuno', 'globulin (Ig) of human origin', ' – sometimes referred to as “immune serum globulin”, “serum immune  globulin”\xa0 or “gamma globulin”', '\r\n  ', 'Specific immuno', 'globulins of human or animal origin,  or produced by recombinant DNA technology ', '- containing  high titres of specific antibodies against a particular microorganism or its  toxin. Products of human origin are preferred over those of animal origin  because of the high incidence of adverse reactions to animal sera and the  longer lasting protection conferred by human immunoglobulins. ', '\r\n', 'Standard  Immunoglobulin (Human) ', 'Standard  human Ig, GamaSTAN®, is a sterile, concentrated solution for intramuscular (IM)  injection containing 15% to 18% Ig. It is obtained from pooled human plasma  from screened donors and contains mainly IgG with small amounts of IgA and IgM. ', 'Subcutaneous  (Sc) and intravenous (IV) Ig preparations are primarily used for continuous  passive immunization for persons with selected congenital or acquired Ig  deficiency states and as an immunomodulator in certain diseases. ', 'Specific Immunoglobulins ', 'Specific immunoglobulins are derived  from the pooled sera of people with antibodies to specific infectious agents;  antisera from horses that are hyper-immunized against a specific organism when  human products are not available; or recombinant DNA technology.  Immunoglobulins from human or animal sources are made by more than one B cell  clone (polyclonal) and can bind to heterogeneous antigens. Antibodies produced through recombinant DNA technology originate from a single clone of B cells (monoclonal) and are specific to  only one antigen. A monoclonal antibody product is  available for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.  Because of the relatively high risk of a specific type of immunological  reaction (known as serum sickness) following the use of animal products, human Ig  should be used whenever possible.', 'Vaccine development', 'How vaccines are developed', 'New vaccines undergo a very rigorous development process. \xa0The first steps in the development of a vaccine include the identification of the microorganism or toxin that causes a significant burden of disease in the population, and an understanding of the biological mechanisms occurring in the development of the disease (pathogenesis). Once the pathogen and pathogenesis are understood, research is initiated into the possibility of developing a vaccine to reduce the disease incidence, or severity, or both. Pre-clinical laboratory testing is carried out to ensure that the candidate vaccine produces the immune response needed to prevent disease and has no toxicities that would prevent its use in people. Clinical trials (human studies) then proceed through several phases involving progressively more study subjects. ', 'Vaccine Safety', ' in Part 2 describes pre-clinical and clinical research throughout the vaccine life cycle and the accompanying regulatory requirements to ensure data and product quality.\r\n', 'How vaccines work', 'Vaccines work at an individual level to protect the immunized person against the specific disease, as well as at a population level to reduce the incidence of the disease in the population, thereby reducing exposure of susceptible persons and consequent illness. Although the primary measure of effectiveness occurs at an individual level, there is also interest in decreasing or even eliminating disease at a population level.', 'How vaccines work at the individual level', 'Administration of a vaccine antigen triggers an inflammatory reaction that is initially mediated by the innate immune system and subsequently expands to involve the adaptive immune system through the activation of T and B cells. While the majority of vaccines provide protection through the induction of humoral immunity (primarily through B cells), some vaccines, such as BCG and live herpes zoster vaccines, act principally by inducing cell-mediated immunity (primarily though T cells). Many vaccines probably work through both, although humoral immunity is the basis most often used as a marker of how well a vaccine works.', 'Long-term immunity requires the persistence of antibodies, or the creation and maintenance of antigen-specific memory cells (priming) that can rapidly reactivate to produce an effective immune response upon subsequent exposure to the same or similar antigen.', 'Markers of protection induced by vaccination', 'A correlate of protection is a specific immune response that is responsible for and statistically linked to protection against infection or disease. Following administration of most vaccines, prevention of infection has been shown to correlate predominantly with the production of antigen-specific antibodies. The quantity and functional activity of antibodies can be measured using serological assays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum bactericidal antibody assay (SBA), and the opsonophagocytic assay (OPA). In cases when a correlate of protection cannot be determined, a substitute (surrogate) immune marker is used. Surrogate markers may not be directly linked to protection against infection or disease. For example, vaccines against rotavirus produce both mucosal and serum antibodies. Whereas serum antibodies are not directly protective against rotavirus infection, they serve as a surrogate of protection since mucosal antibodies are difficult to measure.', "Immunogenicity means the vaccine's ability to induce an immune response. Vaccine-induced seroconversion is the development of detectable antigen-specific antibodies in the serum as a result of vaccination; seroprotection is a predetermined antibody concentration as a result of vaccination, above which the probability of infection is low. The seroprotective antibody concentration differs depending on the vaccine.", 'How vaccines work at the population-level', 'Vaccine efficacy refers to the vaccine\'s ability to prevent illness in people vaccinated in controlled studies. Vaccine effectiveness refers to the vaccine\'s ability to prevent illness in people in the "real world".', 'Herd immunity refers to the immunity of a population against a specific infectious disease. The resistance of that population to the spread of an infectious disease is based on the percentage of people who are immune and the probability that those who are still susceptible will come into contact with an infected person. The proportion of the population required to be immune to reach herd immunity depends on a number of factors, the most important one being the transmissibility of the infectious agent either from a symptomatically infected person or from an asymptomatically colonized person.', 'The reproduction number (R', '0', '), also called the basic reproductive rate, is defined as the average number of transmissions expected from a single primary case introduced into a totally susceptible population. Diseases that are highly infectious have a high R', '0', ' (for example, measles) and require higher immunization (vaccine) coverage to attain herd immunity than a disease with a lower R', '0', ' (for example, rubella, ', 'Haemophilus influenzae', ' type b). ', 'Immunization coverage refers to the proportion of the population (either overall or for particular risk groups) that has been immunized against a disease. To stop transmission of a given disease, there needs to be at least a specified percentage (1 minus 1/R', '0', ') of the population immune to the disease. For example, measles has an estimated R', '0', ' of 15; therefore, at least 94% (1 minus 1/15 = 94%) of the population needs to be immune to prevent transmission of measles.\xa0', 'Determinants of vaccine response in individuals', "The strength and duration of the immune system's response to a vaccine is determined by a number of factors as\xa0outlined in ", 'Table 1', '.', '\r\n', 'Table 1: Determinants of vaccine response in individuals', '\r\n', 'Determinants of vaccine response', '\r\n', 'Explanation', '\r\n', 'Vaccine type', '\r\n', 'The type of vaccine antigen and its immunogenicity directly influence the nature of the immune response that is induced to provide protection:', '\r\n', '\r\n', 'Live attenuated vaccines generally induce a significantly stronger and more sustained antibody response.', '\r\n', 'Non-live vaccines often require adjuvants to enhance antibody responses, usually require multiple doses to generate high and sustained antibody responses, and induce vaccine antibodies that decline over time below protective thresholds unless repeat exposure to the antigen reactivates immune memory.
